As much as I wanted to love the box it came broken. The outside is gorgeous but the inside was another story. The top of the box has thin wood strip to seal it and 3 out of 4 of the sides were broken. Parts of the slats didn’t look good either. Returned it and bought from a different company.,drugstore

"The filter works GREAT.... once I fixed it!!!!! One of the lock down hinges came broken... I could tell that it was obviously broken from the manufacturer as the broken piece was packed under all the filter trays and the only way for it to get there was for some LAZY worker to throw it in after he tried to attach one of the hold down hinges and broke the support bracket. Luckily I am a very handy guy and epoxied it back together rather than send it back. I'm not one to blame the manufacturer for one man's lazy mistake... SHIT happens, but I was not happy when I unpacked it. The filter itself is VERY good!!",pet_products

"My best friend got this mattress before summer started and I've slept on it many times and I get the best sleep at her house. I asked for the mattress as a birthday present, I opened it on the 9th and as I was unrolling it i was starting to smell something musty but i thought it could be because it just traveled in a box for a few days. It's now the 12th and my ENTIRE BOTTOM FLOOR WREAKS OF SOME NASTY MUSTY SMELL. It smells like the bed is rotting. OH and the mattress I ordered is classified as a 6inch mattress but its measuring between 4 and 4 1/2 inches... 3 days later. Today is the first day I have done anything other than touch with my fingers or sniff. The bed feels very firm and if you sniff it you will want to gag. I've already filed through amazon that I'd like a replacement. I'm just puzzled how the mattresses could be so different. We both slept on her brand new, 6 inch, Zinus mattress less than 24 hours after she opened it but mine is like I picked it up off the side of the road. When I get the new mattress I'll edit my review accordingly.",furniture

"I bought it, installed in, went on vacation and started using it when I came back. The suction mount is the worst I've seen in a dashcam or any product. It just doesn't stay put. I had to stick it twice a day for a week and every time it would fall with a thud, without any bumps and while it was parked at night. Second, the recording feature is all over the place. I liked their button settings which make sense. But after setting it up, the camera records randomly, says the disk is full (even if it's set on loop recording) and after formatting and changing card, still gives the error. The other day I found a bump on my car and when I checked the camera, NOTHING was recorded in the parking mode. So, I'm past the return window and should have tested it before going for a vacation. Seemed like a good product from the reviews. Maybe I got a bad unit. But in any case, check it if you buy it, but LOOK ELSEWHERE for a reliable unit.",wireless

Was on phone with customer service for an hour having to literally ARGUE with an agent -- who refused for a long time to transfer me to a supervisor -- and then with a supervisor. After all that, no resolution. All they offered to do was pick up the machine and send it for repairs...but we'd have to stay home, waiting for pick-up, for a 2-3 day period -- which could not even be scheduled for a particular week. (We're leaving for vacation in a couple of days.) Or -- get this! -- they'd email us a shipping label so we could take the machine to UPS at our convenience, but it would take them 2-3 DAYS TO SEND THE EMAIL. An email! After that it would be about a month before we got the machine back. Utter absurdity. **** Like many other reviewers here, I've bought this machine twice -- the first one was good for a couple of years (not as long as I'd expect from this brand), then started pouring water out the bottom instead of through the coffee basket, so I figured I'd just gotten a bit of a dud or the problem was somehow my fault, and I bought a new one. The new one is truly awful -- sounds like a combine harvester, and now, after just 5 months, it makes nothing but sludge with black crema and a half-inch of grounds on the bottom of a weak, bad-tasting cup of coffee. I've cleaned and re-settled all the external parts every way I can think of, to no avail. I'd expect better of a machine that cost half of much.

"I never understand why some manufacturers will create an amazing product and then decide they need to ""fix"" what isn't broken. And it never fails that when they do they ruin it. (Maybe the issue is that what's ""broken"" is their profit margins.) I had been using this product for maybe 15 years with great success. When I ran out of my last jug, I came here to Amazon to buy another and saw there were some negative reviews about the smell. Since I always found the smell very pleasant, I wasn't sure why people were leaving these reviews; I thought maybe they just didn't like it. Then, I saw there was an ""old formula"" being sold. Figuring they made a change, I decided to play it safe and get the ""old"" one. I didn't receive the old formula. (The seller was ""Washington Blvd Sales"".) Instead, I received what I'm positive must be the new formula -- which is awful. It has a headache-inducing perfume, reminiscent of what I remember lice shampoo smelling like. Not only does it not deter my cats peeing in the same spot, it doesn't seem to get rid of the urine smell anymore. I made the mistake of not trying it on a surface before using it. In my defense, I bought the ""old formula"" and assumed it was the same product I've been purchasing for years. Well, I sprayed my couch with it and now it smells like pee and this dreadful perfume. Thanks, Spectrum Brands. Your ""new formula"" has wasted my money and possibly ruined my couch. :(",pet_products

This coffee maker has many issues. I have been doing French press for years. I just imagined that all the drip coffee makers would have a timer. If I have to be there to start it I might as well do French press right? I know that’s my fault to a degree. But the next problem is the pot and the lid. What kind of certifiable lunatic would make the pot so it won’t fit if the lid is on? So when you are done brewing I guess you have to immediately discard the rinds or just let it drip everywhere. It would also be nice if I could fit my hand in the pot to clean it. I by no means have giant hands. I just bought this and used it twice and I already have great disdain for this product imagine this will be exacerbated with time.,kitchen

"UPDATE 2019: after one year (purchased Jan 2018) using this comforter, I can’t say how much I hate it now. It’s so unfortunate. It was great after the first wash but the second & third just went downhill. I only wish each section of this comforter has a seal to keep all the fillings from separating. All the fillings are pretty much gone & this comforter went flat. The extra fillings left would move to the corner specifically to the feet corners which then drags the blanket off to each corner or off the bed. It’s very annoying that I have to shake the fillings to spread out evenly every night. I love how big the blanket is but this problem with the fillings piling up at the end of each corner & how flAt it has gone are a huge problem. I will be tossing this one out. It served well but unfortunately only a year. Before wash: It came inside a zipper bag. It was the perfect size. No damages. No stains. Not used. After wash: It took quite a while to dry since it was a very big blanket. High on dry and blanket came out great. No damages. No threads. No burn. I bought this oversize King for my queen duet cover. I read that to get it big & fluffy its best to buy a bigger insert for the duet. It was perfect. Big and fluffy. Made my bed looks extra soft and comfy. I'm always cold & will need about 2-3 blankets to keep me warm but this blanket was very warm. It kept me warm throughout the whole night. Maybe a little too warm that I kicked the blanket off the bed LMAO!! I think it is more on the heavy side & warmer. But it was perfect to cuddle & wrap my legs on top. My husband loves it as well.

"I love the Vampire Diaries. It's my absolute favorite show. So when I found out Netflix was taking it off I decided that I'm going to buy all of the seasons on DVD. So I ordered this and was excited to receive it. Came just in an ordinary thin bubble mailer with no additional wrapping to protect it. The item itself was wrapped in plastic on the outside like most DVD's come. Take the plastic off and the cardboard sleeve is totally worn on every edge like it's seen years of abuse. Open the plastic case that contains the discs and the case is damaged and the part that holds the discs in and allows you to flip through them is broken and so there's a whole bunch of broken plastic pieces scattered inside the case and now there's nothing holding the disc holders in place inside the case. The discs themselves appear to be okay but there's a scuff on the edge of disc 5 but I think it will be okay and still play, I will update this later on if it does not.",other
Every time you squeeze the handle the hose shrinks down so you have to pull and hold the hose if you are going to continuously use it. Or you can let the pressure build up and use it in short bursts.

"So during 2nd Rifle season, up in the Colorado mountains, on Day 6 of the hunt.. mother nature decided to gift us with ~8 inches of snow. Finally, I had the opportunity to try out my Frogg Togg's and pull them out of my ruck. For the first couple hours, standing up right and walking through the snow looking for elk tracks, they worked great. They kept my legs dry and provided an extra layer of insulation. Despite it being around 13 degrees, my legs and torso were fine and I actually overhearing if anything after about an hour of walking in the snow. Then, we get back to the camp site.... We decided to throw on the snow chains to the truck in case we got can animal and needed mobility to move it. I took my first knee in my brand new, first time ever worn Frogg Togg bottoms... and the crotch blew out. Talk about disappointment. Maybe I received a defective product? Manufacturer/Amazon seller, please let me know if this is true. Or, is taking a knee while wearing these just out if the question? I was wearing 1 layer of thin poly pro's, one pair of super thin athletic pants (ADIDAS), a pair of Carhart hunting pants bottoms, and then XXL Frogg Togg bottoms when this happened. I felt like I was swimming in my clothing and was not expecting the crotch to pop. I mean, I could understand if I was wearing a Large, maybe even a XL, but come on..it was a 2XL. Am I supposed to be rocking 3 or 4X in order to be able to perform a simple function such as taking a knee? In closing.. thankfully the top I have is in good shape and no issues so far. Buyers beware. At least for the pants... which is what you need most! if I wanted to only protect my top, I would have went with my poncho.",sports

For that she recommends the extinction method, softened up by a new name and some witty jokes. The author seems like a very selfish person. She recommends sleep training at 2 months old. Most pediatricians wouldn’t recommend that. Im really happy I listened to my gut and stopped reading",digital_ebook_purchase

I did a load of laundry and spilled way too much detergent into the wash because of consistency. I say this because there was no smell on the clothes when removing them from the washing machine.

"I do NOT recommend this monitor, it’s absolutely horrible. So when it originally came the photos for how to set up the monitor were too small and weren’t really specific, I honestly was surprised given how none of the reviews I seen mention this. Now once I set it up, I thought chatter about colors wasn’t really gonna be a big deal, well it was. Had to spend 30 mins configuring the colors, and even then they weren’t good. So my MAIN issue was, 6 days in the monitor began glitching had started flashing pink on the left side. I thought it was strange and thought nothing of it. Then it evolved to a full pink screen on the left side. That would stay for like 35 mins then disappear except lately it became permanent and no matter how I tweaked it it stayed their. So I’ve decided to return this garbage monitor, while my time when it didn’t have a pink half screen the picture quality was very good, and the 144hz is outstanding, 144hz makes 60hz look like the new 30fps while 144hz is the new 60, but that’s the only upside for me.

"The laptop is fantastic... for the first year and a half. The components are great, good graphics, good memory, good battery; an all around good laptop for work and light gaming. The problem is the case. The case is a piece of crap. It’s made of a brittle plastic, and all of the screw mounts in the screen joints begin to rip out of the plastic simply by the wear and tear of opening and closing the laptop. The screen is only mounted to the mainframe on the right side; the left side is simply screwed into the plastic. I bought the laptop in June of 2017, and right around the corner of New Years 2019 the remaining screws all came loose. This had been building for the last few months as more screws kept coming loose and this caused a strain on the body, bending the fan case and causing the fan to make loud buzzing noises as it scraped against the curvature of the bending. This was entirely caused by opening and closing the laptop over the course of a mere 18 months. I hope I can get a refund.

"I use solar lights as path lights and spot lights all throughout my front yard. I bought these thinking they'd make a nice addition hanging from the crepe myrtle next to our driveway. After receiving them, I realized they came with no way to hang them, so I ordered the hooks and waited for their delivery. Day before yesterday, I was finally ready to put them in my tree. The first night, they looked great. I went out last night with the idea of seeing what they looked like from the front of my house. Imagine my dismay at seeing three of the lights were putting out no light at all, and one you could barely see. I'm not going to climb back up into the tree to take them down. I threw the packaging away after seeing all four worked the first night. Save your time and money. Even if they work after purchase, they may only work one night.",home_improvement

"I purchased my first timer in 2013 and just received a fourth warranty replacement. On average, each timer has worked well for slightly more than one year, and then the integrated backup rechargeable battery fails. The battery is supposed to retain the current date and time for about 24 hours when a power outage occurs. But, either the integrated battery or charging circuitry used by Leviton is deficient. Also, the rechargeable battery cannot be removed and replaced. After about one year the current date and time is lost whenever power flickers for just a moment. Leviton seems to acknowledge the problem indirectly as their customer service has never argued when I request a warranty replacement. But, I am getting tired of the annual replacement schedule. I've also read a number of complaints about this issue on Leviton's knowledge base web page. So, it's not just me, and Leviton doesn't appear to be taking any corrective action.",home_improvement

Guess what I did for Christmas? Not surprised this TV is discontinued. It's a glorified paperweight. Element should stick with making cardboard boxes. I never write reviews but this was a special case. I would avoid buying any Televisions through Amazon. Period. Avoid the hassle and get a name brand TV like a Sony or Samsung. The few extra bucks is worth the peace of mind. Today as I write this, UPS just tried to deliver the same TV I sent out to return for a refund. Didn't bother ringing the door bell with the return label on Tuesday. Welcome to the Holiday Season. Incompetence with both Amazon and UPS. Now I'm going to have to wait probably another week for my refund. If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Buy cheap, get cheap. Just buy a Sony. Don't buy a TV with less than a 4-Star rating and less than 200 reviews. Rule of thumb. P.S. Android is better. Happy New Year!",other

"I purchased this particular handheld model to replace an older one purchased about a year and a half ago. Both my wife and I felt extremely optimistic given the high reviews. However, we are now promptly returning it and will buy from a different brand. First, the crevice tool was never included in the box. If the vacuum actually worked as described, this would not have been a huge issue. As you can probably already infer, the vacuum's functionality (in addition to the missing part) WAS a disappointment. After using it twice (both times fully charged), we realized that our old, much cheaper handheld still worked better. With the brush or extension tube attachment connected, it seemed essentially worthless with regard to suction. Further, even without an attachment, the vacuum literally had no true suction power. It struggled to pick up even the smallest and lightest weight particles on the floor, stairs, counter, etc. Again, given the positive reviews, we were very hopeful that it would be a great replacement. Unfortunately, it's boxed up and will be dropped off at UPS tomorrow.",home

Parts were broken, misaligned, and did not easily 'push' together. The notes below detail these issues. 1. One of the linkage bars on the train engine was not attached to the main drive wheel and just flopped around. Since the bar wasn't necessary I decided to tape it to the side of the engine and see how the train operated. 2. The coupler height between the coal tender and the passenger cars was mismatched to the point that the car would become disconnected whenever the train would go into a curve. I tried each car but they were all the same. 3. The track didn't just 'snap' together.

After 1 day of watching it closely, I noticed that the plastic was melty and it was really hot. I immediately stopped using it. Other people have had this issue - check the pics.

"Over the past 10 years, this might be my first 1-star review of an Amazon seller. I wish I could give it less. Awful customer service. Had to file a claim with Amazon, who, fortunately, is working to assist and make it right. TL; DR: Seller sent a COMPLETELY different item than ordered, the tried to charge me to package/send said 7-8 foot item back to them in order to get a refund. My shipping/packing charges would have been over the price of the original item I ordered. My order: a small, 3-piece patio bistro foldable furniture set. What arrived: a 7-8 foot giant rocking outdoor swing of some kind. Incredibly heavy. 1) I contacted customer service to alert them of the mistakenly shipped item. 2) After months of communicating with their customer service team, requesting my original order, it still never came. 3) I contacted Amazon for help, as the seller refused to cooperate and provide a solution (i.e. a refund, my original order, or means of shipping the incorrect product back at no cost to me.) Worth noting - the packaging the original item arrived in was completely damaged and unusable (leaving scratches and bangs on the incorrect item as well). Best Choice Products customer service team is continuing to ask me to mail the item back (which would involve me purchasing the packing materials for a 7-8 foot item, and paying someone to take it to UPS, as I can't lift this item or fit it in my vehicle). Their solution? Customer service replied with ""see if your friends can give you some free boxes or help you move it."" Their other solution, ""You can pay FedEx to pick it up."" No, this isn't my responsibility as a customer to pay to fix a mistake on the company's end or to pay more than my original item cost to return their mistake.

This product sucks!! I just spent a few weeks in northern Minnesota and they didn't do anything for me even on high. All BS!!And you can't return them lol. They ship them to you ok but when you try to return them you can't and get this. Item can’t be returned since it requires special transportation and handling which we can’t provide. They can provide it to ship to you but they can't to ship it back the same way they shipped it to you. How is that possible? Don't waste your money unless you want to warm your feet in your house not in the stand on a cold morning or evening shoot.Good luck if you buy them.

"A nice idea that is undone by the poor quality. The batteries are a clamshell construction of some brittle plastic. Within a week the two halves had separated. This is likely to occur since when they are inserted into the heel of the insole, there is just a little indent to grab it with your finger, right along the seam. There would be a little tab that allows you to pull the battery out of the insole They replaced the defective pair and the same thing happened with the replacement. I tried to glue the batteries back together but they continue to split. It is also hard to tell if they are working. There is a little green light that flashes when turned on, but it is hidden when inserted. There have been times that one turns on and the other doesn't. Now I have four cracked batteries and no functioning insoles after spending nearly $100 With a better design, better engineering, better materials, and some quality control. this could be a good product.

"I also believe we should all limit salt, artificial flavors and colors, and other potentially harmful substances. This book however takes it to a unrealistic extreme. Even if you slowly moved into this diet it appears unworkable in the modern existence that I lead. I feel that I am more fortunate than most and I still find this proposed diet and I don't think I could afford the time or money it would take to do as it is directed. Another major point of contention is that the author advises the TOTALL elimination of a staggering amount of ingredients found in modern food despite the fact that its admitted that it is unknown if it is actually harmful. If you think you can do this great for you but I think it is misleading to the public. There is some whisper (and not a scientific one) of a chemical, preservative, or additive in food and it is ""Throw it out. Don't let your child near it."".

Two bad cars is very unlikely, but still possible. Three is astronomically unlikely. There is a manufacturing defect somewhere. We’ll be returning the third one and never buying another one of these again.

Second time tried a roast with veggies and cooked it for 8 hours and that worked great too. Please read the cheat sheet that comes in the box. If you read the cheat sheet, you don't cook Brown Rice using the ""Rice"" setting, You have to cook it on ""Pressure Cook"" for 20 minutes with the pressure valve closed and do a quick release. Then the brown rice comes out perfect. The cooker has a stainless steel pot that is super easy to clean. I just wipe, rinse or throw in the dishwasher. I love being able to cook using just one pot.

"Very surprised and disappointed in Thule for this product. Normally their products are well made and constructed. Unfortunately this pad appears to be an afterthought. The straps (as many have mentioned) are attached in a very flimsy manner, and in fact are attached such that they can’t help but separate. A linear pull on the straps or mat delaminates them because they are stitched backwards to the direction of force. An obvious design flaw. Furthermore, the mat lacks any heft at all to hold it down on the angled surface of the vehicle...it’s so light the force of gravity does not even overcome the memory curve you get if you keep it rolled up. Funny though - if you look at the product picture you can see the upward curve of the mat lol. Save yourself some money and go to Kmart, buy TWO bath mats with rubber backings and drape one over your vehicle, and place the other under the back end of your kayak to prevent scrapes as you angle it up onto your racks. You will pay 1/2 of the 40 bucks you would be shelling out for this mat and can use them to throw all of your wet gear on in the back of your vehicle when you’re done. First thoroughly negative review I’ve ever posted on amazon, makes me nervous about other Thule products now...and they always had me as a cheerleader in their corner.",other

The only reason I wanted these was so have clear and color choices. Now I am stuck with the lights on my jeep with no color. Then, they also put in a piece of paper telling you that after you install this, a relay item that you can use for the colors might be defected and will have to be sent back to them for the company see ""IF"" it is defected. I am SO SO SO disappointed with the product. If you want these lights, I suggest you find another manufacture then these guys. Waste of time and money. I will post a picture later of the paper that I am talking about that came in the box.",automotive

"Overall I was pretty displeased with this toy. I got it for my Police K9 so I expect toys to not last as long as they would for a normal drive dog. That being said I noticed problems before the dog even saw the ball. For one, they use a metal washer to keep the string tied onto the ball. Be sure to remove that first before you give it to your dog or run the risk that your dog cracks a tooth and undergoes a painful (and pricy) surgery to have that corrected. When I took out the washer I double and eventually triple knotted the knot at the bottom to keep it in the ball. The dog just has to pull a little and the string pulls right through the ball and you have no handle on your dog or the toy.",pet_products

"Our first bike arrived damaged. After returning the damage bike, the second bike arrived a week later and appeared to be in good condition. Assembly was a challenge as the instructions were blurry, parts were missing, and the tool that was included was not the right size for our bike. But I put it together and the only problem left was the flat front tire. I thought I could fix this by pumping a little air in but no. The stem to the tube was broken off. I had to take the brand new Go Glider bike to a repair shop for them to replace the entire tube in the front tire. The bike repair guy told me stems don’t just break off, it had to be done with some force. So Go Glider had sent me a broken bike. Again. 20 dollars and 20 minutes later (plus one week of you start the clock from the first damages bike we received) this bike is now fixed. But I will never purchase from this company again.

I would turn them on at night, after about 30/45 minutes, I would set the timer for 30 minutes and head to bed.

This is not your normal Lil mover diapers I had the same thing happen to my son as some of the other reviewers. Shortly after starting to use these my son broke out in a horrible rash we have used this diaper before from else where with no issue and even from amazon. Also if your not extremely careful in how you place the diaper the band will cut your child's leg/hip area. Very displeased in these would not recommend buying these. I'm thinking maybe some of these are not really Huggies thrown in with real ones because of the reviews and my own experience. It seems like maybe one in 20 or so is a knock off and if you get them it's horrible I don't plan to risk it again. Furthermore for my son to break out in such a way it worries me of what these diapers contain I hope they don't have some harmful chemical on them.

"I really wish I'd gotten around to setting this up sooner. I would have returned this item. Practically brand new. Nothing 'wrong' with it so to speak, but I got this as an alarm security for my room as our house got broken into back in October. The reason I got this is so it would warn me when someone was in my room and/or record images of the individual. After about 4 or 5 firmware updates (so it was current on firmware) I discovered that the alarm takes a still picture but it was never of me moving, so no picture of someone who would walk in. Also, the alerts came 10 minutes after the motion was detected. It works ok as a live image, and you can record images as long as you are actively on the app, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a live alarm/alert. Moving on, the website and downloads for pc software wouldn't even let me install, and consistently used broken English while trying to download and in it's error messages.",camera

To complicate matters even more, sometimes they were called by their first name and sometimes they were called by their last name. I had a very hard time remembering who was who and what part they played in the story. In the end I just gave up on trying to keep every name, first and last, straight. The author wrote this book like it was a novel with imagined conversations, thoughts, and movements. It was enough to make a real true crime buff crazy! It all sounded so fake and made up! With a complexity of characters and the imagined conversations it was just not a fun book to read. Also, there was NOTHING about the trials other than the results. Had this been my first true crime book, I probably would have never read another one. I have read hundreds and this was one of the worst.

Okay so I ordered this a few days ago and upon arrival all looked good. Packaging and item were not damaged (at least visibly). So I plugged into my iPad and immediately noticed that it wouldn't keep an Audio Connection. Whenever sound would stop playing it would drop the audio connection then when sound started playing again it would pick it back up....sometimes in 1 second other times it wouldn't pick up the audio connection again until the sound was done playing. Then I opened multiple GPS apps on my 2018 iPad Pro and while this device is connected NONE OF THEM will Acquire GPS signal. If I unplug the device to get GPS the second I plug it back in I loose GPS signal again. Even if the device isn't mounted on the corner of the iPad. I can have it plugged in and dangling below the iPad and NO GPS! Honestly after these two problems I quit testing it and threw the piece of crap up on the dash of my semi truck.

"Got these a few days ago and for $90 I could be a lot happier with them. First of all there's no point having the open toe bcz my toes barely show thru the ""peep,"" maybe a scrap of toenail. I tried to push my toes forward a little bit (bcz w/o them showing a little there's an empty opening & it looks like my toes were amputated. Either make the opening big enough to show some toe or make a closed toe shoe.) But it was difficult bcz the shoes are rather narrow. Finally I got some toe poking thru the opening on both shoes but more on the right than the left. The left shoe is more narrow than the right shoe (not bcz my left foot is slightly bigger than my right, in fact, my left foot is slightly smaller than my right) but I figure maybe I can stretch and widen the left sandal a bit. On the weirder side, the left shoe is tighter but the strap around the back is too loose and slips down my heel. Right foot, the strap fits fine, stays up, and the shoe is wide enough. My conclusion? Somebody owes me $45 or a new left shoe. Not sure if I'll try to deal with it or send them back. I have to get ready to move in a couple of weeks and don't need the hassle of an Amazon return right now. I'm not sure how the leather will hold up as far as scuffing goes. I read all the reviews before buying these and no one said anything about how easily they get scuffed or not. I will say this, if the left sandal fit like the the right one I'd be in hog heaven and completely happy. Even with the toe issue. It stinks cuz I really like these shoes...this shoe, not sure what I'll do at this time. Update: I walked around in the shoes a little trying to decide if I should keep them or not and, like some other reviewers said, I found they dug into the tops of my toes. So I sent them back, too many negatives all around. It took the seller two weeks to issue my refund and only after I complained when 11 or 12 days went by and still no refund. Then they docked my refund almost $6 for return shipping even though Amazon gave me a prepaid return shipping label. So they found a way to make some money off me after all --steal it.",shoes

"This is made of real wood and thick, heavy glass; the finish is beautiful although it scratches easily so you must be careful. But I am of the opinion that it is a sad and disappointing waste of materials, as well as time and money. The construction is awful and there is a degree of difficulty even for those experienced in DIY furniture assembly. The parts don't fit together properly, the Cam Lock aluminum hardware is soft and malfunctioning, and the pins pop out and are exposed through the cracks where the side boards and interior shelves should fit snugly and tightly. The end result is a lopsided piece of furniture, with misaligned doors, that can't be trusted to hold any weight. I had ordered the two other matching cabinets, the large and medium size, and had similar problems with their design flaws, and so decided against ordering the small cabinet as intended. At least the cabinets are still standing after a few months. Not this entertainment center! One day I moved it forward a foot or so to plug something into the wall behind it. I moved it back and opened one of the doors. To my chagrin, it fell out into my hand as it reached the open position in the center. Then I tried the other door and alas! the same. When I stood back to inspect I saw what appears to be warping to the bottom board. The doors simply fell from the tracks when they reached the low spot in the bend. That uncomfortable feeling of having been ripped off returned and I junked the thing. I'm not sure what to do with the cabinets as they were a set, but I am quite confident they won't last long either. Heaven forbid I need to move them at all! What a shame.",furniture

"Okay so I was really excited to get these cute little guys and all my phone cords have eventually had exposed wire right in that area so I felt like these would definitely be providing me a service. However, they are far from cute. Which is pretty disappointing. The craftsmanship (or lack thereof) makes them look straight up scary. And then according to the pictures provided on this listing and on other listings for the same products, they show that you are supposed to be able to put the thick plastic part of the charger where the metal comes out into the little dude's mouth but the mouth on all of them is far too small. I have a standard Samsung brand universal charger and it's not even close to being able to fit into any of the mouths. The poor shark was about split in half by the time I shoved the plastic down its throat. And then once it's that way, it doesn't really work how it's supposed to because the cord just falls out of the open slit. Cute idea but these ones are just sad.

I found that no matter what I did, I could not get the board to remain flat and rigid. The board folds in half, then folds again to the wall. The hinge in the middle of the board was ineffective in keeping the board flat when fully extended. As a result, the board would be rigid and level from the wall to the middle hinge, but the half of the board beyond the hinge would flop loosely with about two inches of flex. It would be impossible to use the board. I do not know whether the problem was unique to the board I got, but I was unwilling to try another and returned the product.",home

Worst item ever received from Prime. Couldn’t even handle sage brush clippings. Jams very quickly. Said it has a 6 inch opening. I assumed I could put pine cones in to shred. The opening is 6 inches long by about 1 inch. VERY DIFFICULT TO USE. However - very safe. I sees impossible to get a body part stuck In it. It also has circuit breakers if it jams. It was also very easy to put together. Over all I would say do not buy it. Amazon did make it very easy for me to return.,wireless

Well I can write a review on the product because it was broke when it arrived. I had one in the past that had a metal spout. This one had a plastic spout that was broke off.

"This hodge-podge knock-off of Alien/Predator/Jurassic Park is so filled with ridiculousness that it's only worthwhile as a ""drinking game"" of some sort. As a Sci-Fi thriller, it's worse than pathetic. You have a ""mad genius"" who spouts mind-numbingly incorrect political philosophy and is NO genius. You have the token female bad-ass who is pretty much useless throughout. You have endless jump-scares that aren't scary because they are utterly predictable. You have partial shots of a badly-lit rubber suit monster. You have the rubber-suit's first-person view, which is predictably distorted, as if a creature that sees that way is somehow superior but really can't see well enough to tell up from down. This flick has got it all! ALL the cliche's you could ever ask for in one lame flick. I couldn't finish; I made it about 3/4 and suddenly thought: ""I don't even care how this ends.""

"First thing, the author is a good author who got me started on litrpg. I enjoyed this series up till book 3. Now for the review. This book is a disaster. This is not a litrpg book anymore, it is a romance novel, a poorly written romance novel. The grinding for levels is boring and lacks interesting detail. Story elements that had great potential were aweful. Once again, two to three times a chapter every character talks about how much they love everyone. It is repetitive and lacking in so many ways. The words love and kiss occur over a hundred times a piece throughout this book. They are over used. The assassin plot twist at the end of the last book was great and the author went and made that boring in this book. A potentially great story was screwed up so badly. I am extremely disappointed with how this series turned out. This book was not worth the price tag. I will not be buying the next book because 3 books have been written in a similar manner now.

Package arrived on time. We got the cheaper one that had been opened before. It had some dings in it which we expected for the lower price.

"I have Lutron Caseta throughout the house and have been running it for months - the automation / connectivity reliability for Lutron is rock solid in comparison to this manufacturer - was looking to integrate this device with HomeKit automation of my lights. This is not ready for prime time: 1. Pairing is sporadic. Device is active, but sometimes presents itself to be paired, other times not. Attempted pairing on multiple devices, different iPhones and iPads thinking maybe it was just my iPhone, it wasn't. 2. Device updates are very delayed / latent - as in minutes, sometimes as much as 10-15 minutes. This is supposed to be a sensor that operates in near real time, not sure what the deal is? 3. Automation in Homekit is unreliable. Set up a very simple routine, when it senses movement, turn on the lights. The sensor would blip that it picked up motion - half the time, it would not trigger the automation routine at all. Other times, the latency to trigger the lights would range from 10 seconds to as much as a minute. What's the purpose of that? I'll just turn the lights on manually if it's going to take THAT long. This can't be with Homekit, it's got to be with this manufacturer. With my Lutron set-up, when I turn on the lights through the Homekit app, theres almost imperceptible lag time and 100% reliability to trigger actions, as it should be.",home_improvement

"One star for cuteness and color variety. The rest needs reworking. The touch sensitivity is annoying as it changes colors & modes every time you touch it, which leads to the biggest issue with this nightlight. You HAVE TO PICK IT UP to reach the hard to get to, tiny power button in the rear next to the charging port. For some inexplicable reason, the remote does NOT turn the unit on unless you first press the power button (again, tiny and hard to access in the rear). Poorly designed. So basically to turn it on, you pick it up, press the power button, and since you’re still touching it as you put it down, it cycles through modes. Did I mention it deflates/collapses easily, so you have to reshape it first before putting it down. By the time you set it down it usually ends up on the fast color cycle which is super annoying. Just make the remote able to turn it on so you don’t have to manhandle it every time. Also, the charging port itself isn’t a great fit for the charging cord. Really feels like you’re brute forcing it in. And a full charge is surprisingly short so it’s pretty much plugged in most of the time. This product obviously didn’t go through any honest testing. Definitely disappointing and would not recommend.",baby_product

Very poor quality. There were at least ten parts that came damaged or broken. If we haven’t spent so much time getting replacement parts through South Shore customer service we would have tried returning. Quality is worse than IKEA if that is even possible. Given that it’s so cheaply made the price is actually quite expensive. We only wanted this bed because it seemed more compact and had more useful storage than other high quality beds at Pottery Barn kids or Restoration Hardware. I would say if you don’t need storage just go to the better retailers for quality bed. I do not see this bed lasting longer than 3-4 years.,furniture

"It’s not the easiest chair to get together. It’s even more impossible when you get defective hardware. What kind of quality control is in place to sent a bolt like the one in my picture? The answer is zero. You get what you pay for and this is a trash product. What you get is hex head bolts without the hex head cores cut Update: I went to Home Depot and after 15 minutes of searching the hardware aisle, found a specialty bolt with fine thread that would do the trick. Got home, went to put it in and then found the seat frame was defective too. There’s no threaded place drilled on that side for the bolt. I guess I could try and drill all the way through the seat frame, pick a longer bolt and cap it with a washer and nut. But this frame is so small it would be almost impossible to drill it perfectly straight and not completely damage the integrity of the chair. At this point, my best course of action may be to spend another 45 minutes disassembling and repackaging something that is 95% complete, wasting more time taking it to the UPS store, and get my money back. I’ll only be out the cost of gas, a new bolt and way too much of my time.

One star because I think you have to work real hard to make a dress so poorly sewn together that the seams fall apart like that so easily. the bodice and skirt were nearly completely detached after one gentle wash.

I have a MacBook Air, I have the latest software, and guess what... the concept of ""PLUG and PLAY"" is a darn joke. This has been more like PLUG and THROW AWAY!!!!!!! **** Update: I have contacted DYMO customer service again and have found out the battery was not in the battery compartment, which means it will not work. I assumed with the light turning on it was getting power. Unfortunately this was a packaging error and incomplete project causing me so much wasted time. The man helping me did figure out the problem and although at times condescending in tone was overall helpful, which was obviously the goal.

"This vacuum is terrible. Worst one we’ve ever owned. The bags fill up after one use so you have to constantly buy them. You have forcibly push the power button to get it to turn on or off, however the cord retraction button works if you just look at it. The vacuum will get a thermal shut off if you get animal hair caught in the wand, which is good to protect the vacuum but this is no where in the manual and the vacuum doesn’t tell you. Miele site and support tell you to bring it I’m for servicing at one of their stores. However thanks to the internet if you clear the jam and wait a few hours it works. The thing maneuvers terribly, it won’t move then smashes into everything when it does so if you have no furniture or painted base boards it’s probably fine. I just carry it. The carpet attachment meant for furniture and stairs isn’t powered so only use if you have a fresh bag since it works on suction. It is also not sealed so it jams with fur and you have to either buy a new one or disassemble and clean. Now the wand extension and retraction mechanism broke so I have to buy a new one or vacuum the house hunched over as it only stays at its smallest setting which is like 2 feet. We bought this on the recommendation of family and they felt so bad after they used it they offered to give us the money for it. The floor attachment has horrible suction and design, it pushes anything it finds rather than suck it up. You have to keep lifting it and placing it on top of where you want to vacuum to get it to suck up anything. I wouldn’t recommend this model to anyone.",home

"This is my first negative review on Amazon. I was excited to have a “do it all” griddle, however I was disappointed. 1st ISSUE - I should have returned it after the first use when I realized you cannot cook scrambled eggs without them immediately sliding off into the grease trap. It baffles me - why would I want a more pricy griddle with separate units that you can’t cook both eggs and bacon? Just know that anything with a liquid consistency CANNOT be cooked on this griddle. 2nd ISSUE- After the 2nd use, I realized that the temperature of the two plates did not operate correctly. When I turned down the upper unit (to keep pancakes warm) the lower unit stopped cooking and would not readjust back to set temperature until the upper unit was increased to the same temperature. 3RD & 4TH ISSUES - Also upon 2nd use, two other things surfaced. I realized that the upper unit doesn’t lie down completely flat on the counter surface so it remains sloped even when in the unlocked position. I readjusted to allow the end of the unit to be slightly off the counter. Which is when I realized that the I could no longer see the dials. Over all I do not recommend this unit for those reasons. Just buy the Presto product for half the money, have more cooking space, and an easy to use product. Use the left over money to buy a panini press or a apply it towards an indoor grill.",kitchen

"My first box was Venom. I don't love the pop itself (red lips are huge, looks silly), but at least it looks like a $30 pop. Going rate on ebay is well over that. The rest of the items are of little importance to me because I expect them to be cheap. I was going to cancel, but was suckered by the prospect of the next box. I was expecting a cool pop considering it was for Marvel's First Ten Years edition. I can't think of a lamer pop idea. I can't imagine anyone that wants an Iron Man 2 fight scene between him and Whiplash. Truly terrible. Did I say lame already? Just pure nonsense. Now that next box looks like a retro x-men box so once again I'm lured in. Like many others, I'm going to give the collectors corp one more go before canceling. However, if I get something as stupid as the Whiplash pop I'm done.",toy

The process was slow because my maintenance request was not initially approved. Once it was approved I had to package and send it with a prepaid UPS label that was sent to me. The device was defective and I was sent a replacement SSD. The replacement came as a refurbished SSD. I called Samsung and was told there was an error on my paperwork that put the date of manufacture versus date of purchase. Samsung warranty is a refurbished product 90 days after purchase. I was told to send back the refurbished one so they could send a new SSD. The process took a couple of weeks. I received my new SSD and in May it too failed. I again called Samsung and went through the process. The drive was defective and I was sent a refurbished SSD again. I called Samasung, again. I was told this time it was over 90 days since purchase and a refurbished exchange is their warranty. So I basically only had each new SSD for less than 2 months before they failed.

The AMA uses metal wires on this which they do not do on their ICD Manual. As a result within less than ten days the holes at the bottom and top were tearing with their thin paper.

"Gas spills easily from under lid. Three of us tried using it to verify, open/close lid again and every time it leaked. This is explicitly claimed as ""no-spill"". We were careful from beginning: (1) filled gas at gas station and verified that no single drop spilled while filling, (2) came home and tried to pour slowly into generator... started slow leaking from under lid. We were scared. Though generator was off... it was leaking few drops where generator usually is. So, we moved 15 ft away and filled into a tall glass and noticed the leak again. We cleaned up carefully, moved further and now, other friends tried... same result. Open/close lid, check twice, try again, same result. We figured this is unusable... Gas leak is Hazardous... fumes themselves are highly flammable. Guess what, returns not accepted on this product because... Gas cans shipping has certain constraints. It is not as simple as put in same box and ship. Safety, liability constraints makes returns more expensive than product itself.

"I had really high hopes for this band. Maybe that's why I'm so disappointed in it. The one thing it has going for it is its appearance, and I don't think that's enough reason to deal with its shortcomings. The section with the stars pops out slightly and maybe there's a reason for that, but it ends up picking up additional gunk and is extremely difficult to clean, in part due to all the star cutouts. Even though it looks like it would have decent circulation, it trapped moisture and made my wrist sweat, adding to the gunk buildup problem. It caused the inside of my wrist to develop painful sores. My initial opinion of the band was soured as well, by the things that came in the package, like the sexist booklet shown in the photo. I assume they thought this was 'cute'. Sexism is even worse when believed to be innocuous and acceptable, as it contributes to a cycle of harm. Sexism is never innocuous or 'cute'; it is always dangerous. For the price of this band, you can do much better. The stars may make it unique (and I love almost everything with stars on it) but it doesn't make up for everything else.",sports

The center leg is constantly wobbly, and if the bed moves at all it will get bent under that frame at an awkward angle that scrapes the floor. Use furniture pads under all the legs because they will scratch the holy hell out of your floor too. At first, this bed would squeak intermittently and was slightly wobbly. After a year in the squeaking became out of control and no amount of screw adjusting, tightening, locking, greasing will fix it. It made me so motion sick and mad I could not sleep at all.

I believe the fatal flaw lies in the gimmick of them being easy to replace the rubber blade, they just aren't well enough made. There's a reason you've never heard of this brand. They are knock-off, cheaply made junk and no store would risk it. Stick to the name brands, the price here really is too good to be true. Another thing: most of these 5 star reviews are fake. Look at the 3 posted on July 30th, they all have the same strange ""voice"" and all fail to put any space after punctuation. (So.they.look.like.this,weird,huh?)

Very disappointed. I was excited to try a natural way to dye hair and a product that CLAIMED to be able to dye dark hair fun colors. No surprise that unbleached hair will not dye a fun color. I thought blue smoke would be a nice dark blue on my natural dark brown hair. After leaving it in for 2 hours (recommended by the website) I rinsed it out and got jet black with a couple blue patches where my hair has been bleached in the past. Needless to say I will not be wasting my money on this again. Go to Sally’s and buy bleach and ion semi-permanent color if you have dark hair. If you’re blonde this product might work for you.,beauty

The only reason I give these shoes a one rating is because when I wore them I was a fish bit me twice on the foot due to the bright colors reflecting in the water and thinking it was coral. After I took the shoes off I was fine! So don’t buy a bright flashy color if you plan on wearing them in the ocean! Otherwise they were a great fit and I wish I would have purchased a neutral or black color instead!,shoes
